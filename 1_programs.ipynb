    "These files are Jupyter notebooks designed to accompany the digital book **Python Programming by Doing**.\n",
    "Its content is based on the books **Python for Everybody** by **Charles Severance** and **Think Python (2nd edition)** by **Allen Downey**. \n",
    "The code fragments have mostly been taken from the books and adapted in many cases.\n",
    "You are encouraged to **play along** in these files as you read the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The more you practice programming the better your programming skills will become! You do not learn programming by just reading code, you have to write the code yourself!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, before writing the first line of code, you have to solve the problem in your head, on a blackboard, or on paper. If you start solving the problem at hand by immediately writing code, you will spend a lot of time because it is a very inefficient way of working. It is too much \n",
    "trial-and-error. You first need to understand the problem, mentally create a solution, figure out whether you have dealt with all possible exceptions, also called (corner) cases, and then start writing the code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a cell, select it by clicking on it, and then click the `Run` cell button in the toolbar at the top, or press `Shift + Enter`. \n",
    "If this is your first use of Jupyter, then take the **User Interface Tour** (see `Help > User Interface Tour`). See `Help > Notebook Help` for more details, such as how to format Markdown cells.\n",

    "## 2. Algorithms <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"algorithms\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply reasoning to address issues in daily life. \n",
    "We rely on so-called algorithms to accomplish this. \n",
    "Algorithms are not the same as logic. \n",
    "On the other hand, an algorithm makes decisions about how to solve a (well specified) problem using logic. \n",
    "A finite series of precise instructions used to solve a problem is known as a \"algorithm,\" in short. \n",
    "This definition makes it appear as though we develop, improve, and use algorithms every single day of our lives, doesn't it? \n",
    "Consider the algorithm (or series of processes) you use to bake a cake or prepare a certain meal, or the algorithm you use to get dressed in the morning. \n",
    "We have assimilated those algorithms as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design an algorithm, we usually first need to specify the following set of elements:\n",
    "1. the **problem** to be solved or question to be answered. If you do not have a well-defined problem you might end up designing a very efficient but *useless* algorithm that does not solve the problem at hand. Thus, ensure you understand the problem before thinking about a solution;\n",
    "2. the **inputs** of the algorithm–that is, the data you require to compute the solution;\n",
    "3. the **output** of the algorithm–that is, the expected data that you want to get out of your solution, and;\n",
    "4. the **algorithm** or sequence of steps that you will follow to come up with an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    Get used to <b>always</b> writing down these 4 elements before you start solving a programming problem.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Without having a clear picture of your problem, and the expected inputs and output to solve that problem, it will be unlikely that you will be able to come up with a proper algorithm. \n",
    "Furthermore, beware that for algorithms to be useful, they should **terminate** at some point (they cannot just run forever without providing a solution!) and output a correct result. An algorithm is **correct** if it outputs the right solution to every possible input. \n",
    "Proving this might be unfeasible, which is why testing your algorithm (maybe after implementing a program) is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order solve a particular problem there maybe a whole range of algorithms, not just one. The difference is often in the way a problem is solved, the amount of data that needs to be processed, etc. An important measure to compare algorithms is complexity, not complexity of the code, but the number of steps needed to solve the problem at hand. An algorithm maybe linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential. Given some input does the algorithm need a linear number of steps to calculate the output, a quadratic number of steps, etc. For small inputs, exponential is not a real problem but a small increase in the number of data points in the input may already be problematic in case of exponential.\n",

    "Writing down an algorithm is of great importance given that you do not only guarantee that you can execute the algorithm in future opportunities, but you also provide a means to share the algorithm, so other people can benefit from what you designed. \n",
    "To be able to *write down* the algorithm, we require an additional tool–that is, a (programming) language. \n",
    "However, the algorithms we want to write down must be written in a language that can be understood by a computer.\n",
